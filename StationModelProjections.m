function [baseline_model, tempAnnMeanAnomaly, P] = StationModelProjections(station_number)

% StationModelProjections Analyze modeled future temperature projections at individual stations
%===================================================================
%
% USAGE:  [baseline_model, tempAnnMeanAnomaly, P] = StationModelProjections(station_number) <--update here
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Use this function to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the
%   annual temperature over the baseline period, mean temperature anomaly,
%   and the slope and intercept for the fit for data from all stations in
%   the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)%
% INPUT:
%    staton_number: Number of the station from which to analyze historical temperature data
%    **Describe any other inputs you choose to include**
%
% OUTPUT:
%    baseline_model: [mean annual temperature over baseline period
%       (2006-2025); standard deviation of temperature over baseline period]
%    tempAnnMeanAnomaly: Annual mean temperature anomaly, as compared to
%       the 2006-2025 baseline period
%    P: slope and intercept for a linear fit to annual mean temperature
%       values over the full 21st century modeled period
%   **list any other outputs you choose to include**

%% Read and extract the data from your station from the csv file
filename = ['model' num2str(station_number) '.csv'];
%Extract the year and annual mean temperature data
stationdata = readtable(filename);
temps = table2array(stationdata(:,2))
years = find(stationdata.Year<=2025 & stationdata.Year>=2006);
%% Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the annual mean temperatures
%  over the baseline period over the first 20 years of the modeled 21st
%  century (2006-2025) - if you follow the template for output values I
%  provided above, you will want to combine these together into an array
%  with both values called baseline_model

ann_mean_mean = nanmean(temps(years));
ann_mean_std = nanstd(temps(years));
baseline_model = [ann_mean_mean, ann_mean_std];
%% Calculate the 5-year moving mean smoothed annual mean temperature anomaly over the modeled period
temps_mean = mean(temps)
anomaly = temps_mean - ann_mean_mean
smooth_anomaly = movmean(anomaly,5)%<-- smoothed anomaly

%% Calculate the linear trend in temperature this station over the modeled 21st century period
P =  polyfit(years,anomaly,1);
